    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/subversion.jpg" title="&lsquo;Subversion Logo&rsquo;" >An important notice to users of the hot-backup.py utility which ships with subversion.</p>

<p>I found our nightly backup of subversion was failing with the following error:</p>

<pre><code>svnadmin: Can't open file '/pathtorepo/db/fsfs.conf': No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>What was troubling me was:</p>

<ol>
<li>How come a file is missing in my svn repository &ndash; nothing has changes (As far as I know &hellip; :)</li>
<li>hot-backup.py script hasen&rsquo;t changed much, how come my version has changed ?</li>
</ol>


<p>So I looked up the subversion&rsquo;s change log: <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/tags/1.6.12/CHANGES">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/tags/1.6.12/CHANGES</a> which is the latest release (1.6.12) and took a look on my svn machine to find which version was installed and I found 1.6.12 was indeed in talled and in 1.6.11 release notes you will find:</p>

<pre><code>* make 'svnadmin hotcopy' copy the fsfs config file (r905303)
</code></pre>

<p>In addition I took a look at hot-bakup.py change log under: <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/subversion/trunk/tools/backup/hot-backup.py.in?view=log,">http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/subversion/trunk/tools/backup/hot-backup.py.in?view=log,</a> and found that indeed the fsfs file has be included in the hotbackup script since the 1.6.11 version of the file (see link speified above).</p>

<p>Googeling on the fsfs.conf subject led me to: <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.subversion.user/97647">http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.subversion.user/97647</a> which noted the same exact issue.</p>

<p><strong>How do we solve this issue</strong><strong>?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Create a test repository &ndash; svnadmin create /tmp/svntest which will create the fsfs.conf under /tmp/svntest/db/fsfs.conf</li>
<li>Copy the fsfs.conf to your svnroot/db directory and walla you have the fsfs.conf (what this file does is a different topic)</li>
</ol>


<p>Please note:</p>

<p>1. The svnadmin upgrade &ndash;<strong>Doesn&rsquo;t add this file so unless you are using an old veriosn of the hot-backup.py script your backups will fail!!!</strong> (beleive me I tried).</p>

<p>2. If you update subverison &ndash; don&rsquo;t forget to run <em>svnadmin upgrade /pathto yourrepo/</em> or you miss all the point of upgrading</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve learened that subversion was upgraded (again which doesn&rsquo;t say your repository was upgraded!!!) &ndash; but when? &ndash; considering the fact I am running CentOS &ndash; and I didn&rsquo;t have to compile SVN from source and start checking the subversion binaries Creation / Update time I used RPM to tell me when subverions was installed and there is was:</p>

<pre><code>[root@dev ~]# rpm -qi subversion
Name        : subversion                   Relocations: (not relocatable)
Version     : 1.6.12                       Vendor: Dag Apt Repository

</code></pre>

<p>I think the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%231">#1</a> lesson learned here is before you upgrade read the release notes, see if it impacts you environment in any way &ndash; then you can upgrade.</p>

<p>Hope you find this useful.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/subversion.jpg" title="&lsquo;Subversion Logo&rsquo;" >Remembering all the svn switches / CLI options, not necessary, well unless you are using some nifty GUI tool you will definitely need this one.</p>

<p>Just google &ldquo;Subversoin bash completion&rdquo; and you will find yourself <a href="http://worksintheory.org/files/misc/bash_completion_svn">here</a></p>

<p>so grab is, source it and use it:
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>apt-get install bash-completion
</span><span class='line'>wget &lt;a <span class="nv">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;http://worksintheory.org/files/misc/bash_completion_svn&quot;</span>&gt;http://worksintheory.org/files/misc/bash_completion_svn&lt;/a&gt; -O /etc/bash_completion.d/subversion
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>You are good to go.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong>
Installing the bash_completion deb package adds a bunch of bash completion helpers see full list by running:
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>dpkg -L bash-completion
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>All the magic however is in this short file:
/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh and anything you place under <em>/etc/bash_completion.d/</em> will automatically be sourced upon login &hellip;</p>

    <link href="http://hagzag.github.io/blog/2008/11/09/subversion-server-side-action/"/>
    <updated>2008-11-09T09:11:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://hagzag.github.io/blog/2008/11/09/subversion-server-side-action</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/subversion.jpg" title="&lsquo;Subversion Logo&rsquo;" ><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>I am at a clients location which develops on windows and the &ldquo;EOL&rdquo; end of line is what is called CRLF unlike unix/linux which is naturally the servers platform which uses LF only (<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html">more details about CRLF/LF here</a>).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">we had to solve two issues</p>

<ol>
<li>Set a property on the level of SVN to set a default EOL of CRLF to certain file types for example .bat and .properties</li>
<li>Set the property to all the files with those extensions which already exist in repository.</li>
</ol>


<p>For issue <strong><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%231">#1</a></strong> a few methods could apply in the client side &ndash; but we wanted to solve this on server side after investigating this issue the solution was quite simple &ndash; with the help of our ALM team of course.</p>

<p>Edit the file called svnserve which is located under $SVNROOT/conf/svnserve.conf and add the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>[miscellany]
enable-auto-props = yes 
[auto-props]
*.png = svn:mime-type=image/png
*.jpg = svn:mime-type=image/jpeg
*.bat = svn:eol-style=CRLF
*.txt = svn:eol-style=CRLF
*.properties = svn:eol-style=CRLF
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I added a few more extensions while I was at it.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>

<p>SVN usually &ldquo;guesses&rdquo; the type of file and has a classification called &ldquo;native&rdquo; the native classification tags the file in its native OS mode for example a .sh file will automatically receive an LF end of line although I guess there are a few extensions which SVN doesn&rsquo;t recognize the result would be a file which is broken up into two lines instead of the original line brakes the developer used whilst editing the file.</p>

<p>for issue <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%232">#2</a> this has two methods</p>

<p>one: commit files manually + add  svn:eol-style=CRLF to each file then commit it to SVN and of course from this revision onwards the file will have a CRLF eol</p>

<p>second: and the more elegant way is two write a short script which will set a property to all files with .bat &amp; .properties extension and of course submit this to SVN.</p>

<p>I used the following <a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/client-side/svn_apply_autoprops.py">script</a>:  checkout the repository you wish to enforce the properties on in my case &ldquo;trunk&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>[Myserver]$ mkdir trunk
[Myserver]$ svn co http://Myserver/svn/repos/trunk trunk
[Myserver]$ cd trunk
[Myserver]$ wget http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/client-side/svn_apply_autoprops.py
[Myserver]$ chmod u+x svn_apply_autoprops.py
</code></pre>

<p>now run the script &ndash; the script automatically runs on CWD &ldquo;.&rdquo;!</p>

<pre><code>[Myserver]$./svn_apply_autoprops.py
 
</code></pre>

<p>check a few of your files to see that properties were set to your specification &ndash; the specifiactaions are inherited from the $SVNROOT/conf/svnconf.conf file as stated earlier in this article.</p>

<pre><code>[Myserver]$ svn pl svn pl base/javalib/antInstaller/LICENSE-ant.txt
</code></pre>

<p>your output should be something like:</p>

<p>Properties on &lsquo;base/javalib/antInstaller/LICENSE-ant.txt&rsquo;:<br/>
svn:eol-style</p>

<p>you can do the same checkup with tortoise.</p>

<p>Once you are sure all properties were made to your WC to your satisfaction you can commit your changes to repository (you will have to have &ldquo;rw&rdquo; perms to trunk in order to commit !)</p>

<pre><code>[Myserver]$ svn commit http://myserver/svn/repos/trunk -m "add properties to files / CRLF property"
</code></pre>

<p>update / checkout from a different machine / working copy and see if your changes were submitted successfully &ndash;</p>

<p>Thats it, mission accomplished.</p>

<p>Hope you find this useful.</p>
