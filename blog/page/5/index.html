  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/hudson_logo.png" title="'Hudson Logo'" >In one of my previous projects I needed to deploy 2 Tomcat servers as part of the build process, this could be done by profiling the parent project with a Deploy life cycle although we wanted to avoid errors due to miss use &ndash; therefore leave this task for a continues integration server &ndash; you guessed right &ndash; HUDSON.</p>

<p>My test consisted on completing two build life cycles of <em><strong>mvn clean install</strong> </em>then collect three wars, deploy into a remote Tomcat webapps dir, set some spring.properties and start both Tomcats.</p>

<p>So this task seemed quite simple for Hudson to be able to execute, my recipe was:</p>

<ol>
<li>A parametrized build &ndash; which will set the remote tomcat home &amp; remote db variables (passed in spring.properties within wars) [<a href="#figure1">see example scrrenshot below</a>]</li>
<li>A hudson slave instance (so I will build directly on the remote host)</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org//display/HUDSON/M2+Extra+Steps+Plugin">The m2 extras steps plugin</a></li>
</ol>


<p>After running the build about half a dozen times I learned that Hudson is killing those Tomcats as soon as the build is successful &ndash; this seemed odd.</p>

<p>The build consisted of deploying 3 war files into webapps dir, taking tomcat down, overriding spring.properties files in each war and then start two tomcats instances so new setting are effective.</p>

<p>On the remote machine during build time, <em>netstat</em> showed that services are up and running, in addition to Hudson&rsquo;s build log wchich showed all wars were copied and all spring.properties files are in place &ndash; so what could be the issue here?</p>

<p>At some point it occurred to me &ndash; and seemed almost natural that these services should be killed, because they are forked / sub processes of Hudson, and therefore will not continue &ldquo;living&rdquo; once there parent process is dead.</p>

<p>So still how do you solve this?</p>

<p>The solution was to pass an argument to Hudson called BUILD_ID with a default value of dontkillme which solved the issue.</p>

<p>you can read about this &ndash; it will probably save you some time if your in the same situation see: <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-2729?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:all-tabpanel">HUDSON-2729</a></p>

<p><em>Although according to the above link</em>:</p>

<pre><code>"This is fixed in 1.283.

The side effect of this is that if someone has been intentionally spawning
processes, those will be killed, too. This is based on environment variables, so
to work around this, you can spawn processes with one of the environment
variables different from what Hudson sets. For example,
BUILD_ID=dontKillMe catalina.sh start
will start Tomcat in such a way that it'll escape the killing."
</code></pre>

<p>I am running on 1.338 and this is still an issue &ndash; but, I was performing the build via slave, which might complicate the issue. For it is not only a sub process of Hudson, but a &ldquo;sub-process of a sub-process&rdquo; &ndash; now, if you recall I am running a parametrized build so I set the BUILD_ID=dontkillme as a default parameter to this build, and I solved this issue.</p>

<p><strong>Hope you find this useful</strong></p>

<time datetime="2009-12-05T09:11:00+05:30" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 5<span>th</span>, 2009</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><em>Background</em>:</strong></p>

<p>In one of my previous projects I was asked to setup the environment / automate <strong>integration tests</strong> (Referred to as Itest from now on) which required a machine with 2 CPU&rsquo;s &amp; 5 GB RAM, this means that in any case a developer wishing to run Itests will never be able to run them locally, and will have to use some existing server.</p>

<p>The problem with my previous statement is that the developer, whilst checking his tests will be busy most of the time preparing his Itest environment, rather then checking the integrity of his tests, need I say that the fact we need 2 CPU&rsquo;s &amp; 5GB RAM means the server takes time to load and only once it is up you can start testing.</p>

<p><strong>From a Continues Integration point of view</strong>, these tests should run as part of the Nightly build, automatically &amp; with no user intervention and of course the running server should be using the latest tests from SCM.</p>

<p>The big question was: <strong><em>how do we achieve all of the above with one Maven Project one Job in Hudson-CI and reuse this code as a Maven module for every new scenario we are testing?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Solution</em></strong>:</p>

<p>Hudson, Maven &amp; some Groovy on top (<em>or beneath in order to be accurate</em>):</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.hudson-ci.org/">Hudson</a> &ndash; a built in mechanism of Tokenized builds &amp; parametrized builds which can be invoked by browsing a url</li>
<li><a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> &ndash; or any other build tool for that matter can invoke a Hudson url</li>
<li><a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> &ndash; the logic of build invocation is performed by <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GMAVEN/GMaven+1.0+Release">Maven Groovy Plugin</a> &ndash; this is what the client choose, and did most of the writing.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong><em><img src="/assets/images/banner-100.png" alt="Hudson logo" /></em></strong><img src="/assets/images/Maven_logo_0.gif" alt="" /><img src="/assets/images/medium.png" alt="Gmaven" /></p>

<p>OK so how does this all come together?</p>

<p><strong>On the <em>Maven side / Developer&rsquo;s side</em></strong> there is a &ldquo;skeleton&rdquo; parent pom with some Groovy logic (I will ask clients permission to attach the code to this post) of how to build the hudson url &amp; pass the token&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Parent pom includes Groovy logic which uses the a <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/modules/http-builder/apidocs/groovyx/net/http/URIBuilder.html#toURL%28%29">url.toURL</a> method whilst passing a token and a parameter to hudson, a time to wait period which waits until we receive &ldquo;Build Successful&rdquo; from Hudson and fail after a set period of time (or it will run for ever &hellip;) &ndash; parent pom is not to invoke any build but is there so its modules will inherit the url construction logic.</p>

<p>Maven module <strong><em>X</em></strong> has parameters therefore executes the constructed <em>Hudsonurl</em> + <em>Hudsontoken</em> + <em>Jobparam</em>, so does Maven module <em><strong>Y</strong></em> &amp; <em><strong>Z</strong></em> etc etc &hellip;</p>

<p><em><strong>In Hudson</strong></em></p>

<ul>
<li>A slave machine dedicated for Itest / a slave capable &amp; available of running the Itest job &ndash; how to set up will be posted in a separate post</li>
<li>A valid url Token, so it can only be invoked by people / code who &ldquo;know&rdquo; the Token</li>
<li>A Parameter which is passed to Hudson Build step</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/assets/images/HCI-string_param_0.png" alt="Hudson String Param" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/HCI-job_token_0.png" alt="Hudson Job Tiken" /></p>

<p><em><strong>Please note</strong></em><strong>:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Token option is available only when running from within a servlet container if your test driving this with java -jar this option will not be available!.</li>
<li>The defualt value of &ldquo;default&rdquo; is there so when hudson runs with no parameter this value will take presence if ot is not there build will not be able to run!.</li>
</ul>


<p>In a freestyle project the build can look like this (for win / linux):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/HCI-job-builder.png" alt="Hudson Job Builder" /></p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Future Enhancements</em></strong><em>(might need to add in the future)</em>:</p>

<p>As this project involves and there are more and more developers we will need more than one continues integration machine, and we do not want to start specifying the name of the machine inside the project&rsquo;s pom or we will find ourselves editing the pom several times a week.</p>

<p>A Hudson built in solution would be to tie the job to a Group of Nodes rather than a specific Slave Hostname, and add a few machines to that group this will result in the ability to invoke multiple jobs simultaneously.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/hudson_logo.png" title="'Hudson Logo'" >A neat addition to your <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Meet+Hudson">Hudson Continues Integrationn</a> server, is the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Backup+Plugin">Hudson Backup plug-in</a>.</p>

<p>If you are during a major change in your build configuration, backup your configurations and you can restore from the backup when / if needed.</p>

<p>It is just much more elegant then copying those XML file&rsquo;s and editing them by hand when in comes to restoring your configuration&hellip; believe me I&rsquo;ve been there &hellip; (tested with Hudson 1.327 and 1.335 which is one release since the latest).</p>

<p>The basic backup just backs up Hudson&rsquo;s configuration although you can also backup builds history &amp; artifacts and more &ndash; please make sure to configure what the backup should actually pickup (<a href="#ScrrenShot">see screen shot below</a>), by default it only backs-up configuration files.</p>

<p>The plug-in is in it&rsquo;s early stages although quite adequate for simple tasks, if your interested the plug-in is planing on supporting:</p>

<ol>
<li>Speed improvement (it is pretty slow &hellip;)</li>
<li>Support Hudson launched via java -jar hudson.war</li>
<li>Build history management (number of backup to keep, &hellip;)</li>
<li>Incremental backup</li>
<li>Backup jobs individually</li>
<li>Automatic backup file format detection on restore</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="/assets/images/HudsonCI-BackupConfig.png" alt="Hudson CI Backup" /></p>

<p><strong>Another important thing to note: </strong><em>Backup will restart Hudson</em> so if you have any job&rsquo;s running Hudson will wait until they are complete in order to perform the backup.</p>

<p>Hope you find this useful &hellip;</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/subversion.jpg" title="'Subversion Logo'" ><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>I am at a clients location which develops on windows and the &ldquo;EOL&rdquo; end of line is what is called CRLF unlike unix/linux which is naturally the servers platform which uses LF only (<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html">more details about CRLF/LF here</a>).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">we had to solve two issues</p>

<ol>
<li>Set a property on the level of SVN to set a default EOL of CRLF to certain file types for example .bat and .properties</li>
<li>Set the property to all the files with those extensions which already exist in repository.</li>
</ol>


<p>For issue <strong><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%231">#1</a></strong> a few methods could apply in the client side &ndash; but we wanted to solve this on server side after investigating this issue the solution was quite simple &ndash; with the help of our ALM team of course.</p>

<p>Edit the file called svnserve which is located under $SVNROOT/conf/svnserve.conf and add the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>[miscellany]
enable-auto-props = yes 
[auto-props]
*.png = svn:mime-type=image/png
*.jpg = svn:mime-type=image/jpeg
*.bat = svn:eol-style=CRLF
*.txt = svn:eol-style=CRLF
*.properties = svn:eol-style=CRLF
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I added a few more extensions while I was at it.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>

<p>SVN usually &ldquo;guesses&rdquo; the type of file and has a classification called &ldquo;native&rdquo; the native classification tags the file in its native OS mode for example a .sh file will automatically receive an LF end of line although I guess there are a few extensions which SVN doesn&rsquo;t recognize the result would be a file which is broken up into two lines instead of the original line brakes the developer used whilst editing the file.</p>

<p>for issue <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%232">#2</a> this has two methods</p>

<p>one: commit files manually + add  svn:eol-style=CRLF to each file then commit it to SVN and of course from this revision onwards the file will have a CRLF eol</p>

<p>second: and the more elegant way is two write a short script which will set a property to all files with .bat &amp; .properties extension and of course submit this to SVN.</p>

<p>I used the following <a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/client-side/svn_apply_autoprops.py">script</a>:  checkout the repository you wish to enforce the properties on in my case &ldquo;trunk&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>[Myserver]$ mkdir trunk
[Myserver]$ svn co http://Myserver/svn/repos/trunk trunk
[Myserver]$ cd trunk
[Myserver]$ wget http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/client-side/svn_apply_autoprops.py
[Myserver]$ chmod u+x svn_apply_autoprops.py
</code></pre>

<p>now run the script &ndash; the script automatically runs on CWD &ldquo;.&rdquo;!</p>

<pre><code>[Myserver]$./svn_apply_autoprops.py
 
</code></pre>

<p>check a few of your files to see that properties were set to your specification &ndash; the specifiactaions are inherited from the $SVNROOT/conf/svnconf.conf file as stated earlier in this article.</p>

<pre><code>[Myserver]$ svn pl svn pl base/javalib/antInstaller/LICENSE-ant.txt
</code></pre>

<p>your output should be something like:</p>

<p>Properties on &lsquo;base/javalib/antInstaller/LICENSE-ant.txt&rsquo;:<br/>
svn:eol-style</p>

<p>you can do the same checkup with tortoise.</p>

<p>Once you are sure all properties were made to your WC to your satisfaction you can commit your changes to repository (you will have to have &ldquo;rw&rdquo; perms to trunk in order to commit !)</p>

<pre><code>[Myserver]$ svn commit http://myserver/svn/repos/trunk -m "add properties to files / CRLF property"
</code></pre>

<p>update / checkout from a different machine / working copy and see if your changes were submitted successfully &ndash;</p>

<p>Thats it, mission accomplished.</p>

<p>Hope you find this useful.</p>

What I encountered now was a case where I had to set a specific property on a large number of files which were already committed to svn.</p>

<p>Well, one could spend a week locating those files and setting the properties manually but the elegant way would be to write a short shell script which will do the job for you.</p>

<p>so because I had multiple locations I chose to run the script on the server itself so I am not hanging on http protocol + I am using svn file and not http but this can be easily done by via http too.</p>

<p>So if your svn is build out of trunk, branches and tags so I would like to go over trunk for example and checkout first level directories look for a file extension and change its property (of course If you want to set more then one property you will have to modify this script) then set its property and commit so I created a file containing the names of the first level directories after trunk and out them into a file called trunk.list</p>

<p>Task list:
1. checkout from svn
2. find files with extension .properties (or any other extention I/you desire)</p>

<ol>
<li>set svn property eol CRLF</li>
<li>commit change to svn</li>
</ol>


<p>So I wrote in bash a short loop that would read the file and for each line do the four tasks I wanted:</p>

<pre><code> #!/bin/bash

 #set vars
 SVNUSER=opencm
 SVNPASS=opencm
 file=$2
 cat $file | while read line;
 do
 # "now" var will be used for commit message
 now=`date +%Y_%m_%d_%T`
 # checkout
 svn co --username $SVNUSER --password $SVNPASS file:///path-to-svnroot/trunk/$line /tmp/$line
 cd /tmp/$line
 # set the property of CRLF to the found files
 find&amp;nbsp; /tmp/$line -name "*.$1" | xargs -r svn propset svn:eol-style CRLF
 # commit the changes to svn
 svn commit -m "setting svnprop eol=CRLF done on $now"
 # remove eorking copy
 rm /tmp/$line -Rf

 done
 exit 0

 #EOF
</code></pre>

<p>to execute the command you need to command line args $1 file extension for example txt and $2 is the list of the directories you are checking out of svn so from command prompt it should look like:</p>

<pre><code>[opencm@localhost ]# ./chgCRLFprop.bash txt trunk.list
</code></pre>

<p>And if you really want to continue working in the process add this &ldquo;> chgCRLFprop.log 2>&amp;1 &amp;&rdquo; to the end of the command which will send the job to the background and you can also reference the log if you like.</p>

<p>Give it a test run first running the script without the svn commit.</p>
