Today weâ€™re pleased to announce the public availability of the first Chef Server 12 Release Candidate. This release brings the differentiating features of Enterprise Chef, namely multi-tenancy and role-based access control, into Open Source Chef.
{% endblockquote %}

The most exciting features I found ... (among others)
1.  On-prem supermarket - start caching those cookbooks into your infrastructure to reduce the download time ...
2. Reduce the OS footprint thanks to code consolidation, from my test this reduced the installation time and manageability of the server (and it's services).
3. High Availability (which I still need to checkout for myself ...)
4. Replication

Way to go Chef !
